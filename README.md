# readme-generator

ReadMe generator is a Node.js command line application that uses Javascript coding to dynamically generate a project README.md file. 
The application accesses the Inquirer Node.js package to generate a set of user input prompts. Once the user completes the prompts, application
runs the inputs through the code and using a template literal containing the file outline, creates the ReadMe file. Additionally, I utilized
the Axios package to make a call to the Github API to access my personal avatar link to add into the ReadMe. file.

I designed and created this application to demonstrate understanding of Node.js for non-brower based application generation, as well as
use of template literals for use easier, more dynamic multi-line strings and string interpolation.

Key Features:

Use of Node.js functionality to create a command line application, independent of browser functionality.

Use of Inquirer package and template literals to dynamically generate a ReadMe file.

Use of Axios package to make Github API call to access personal Github avatar.
